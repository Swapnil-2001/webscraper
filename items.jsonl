Twitter RSS Feeds for Publishers For Reporters My Account Log In June 16, 2023 Cash is King: How A Capital Strategy Can Enable Today\u2019s Start-Ups to Survive Darren Bartlette, Kalon Gutierrez, Richard McDerby Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP + Follow x\u00a0Following x\u00a0Following - Unfollow Contact LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Send Embed To embed, copy and paste the code into your website or blog: 2023 has proved to be challenging for many cash-conscious startups, especially those that anticipated raising venture capital in the first half of the year. As the Federal Reserve continues to increase interest rates in an effort to curb high inflation, the public market pullback, especially in the tech sector, and fears of a looming recession have made many investors hesitant to deploy new capital. Such fears have largely quelled the pandemic era of high valuations and easy access to cash for startups. During the \u201cgood times\u201d of the past few years, many startups (including those with relatively limited track records) and their founders were able to access venture debt to bolster balance sheets and extend cash runways without the dilutive effect of raising investor money. However, the recent bank failures have significantly impacted the venture community, threatening to upend access to venture debt facilities. Although there are a few bright spots (like artificial intelligence and climate tech), with private company valuations falling and lower availability of venture debt, we expect startups will need to further preserve cash and resources to navigate the expected continued rocky terrain ahead. Here are some measures that startups should consider in the near term: Clear Cash Flow Projections Startups should optimize their balance sheets and scrutinize all accounts receivable and accounts payable. Startups should send routine reminders of all outstanding debts to any customer who is delinquent on payments and should do so until such debts are fully paid. To the extent possible, companies should ensure that all accounts payable are paid on time and in full to avoid any unnecessary late fees or interest payments. Startups should make sure their financial systems are accurately capturing all transactions to ensure the management team can make financial decisions confident in the fidelity of company cash flow and obligations. Further, companies should take a conservative approach when modeling expected cash flow projections over the next few months or quarters. These steps will allow a company to get a true understanding of its current cash position and help provide clarity on what can be scaled back, if necessary. Reduce Cash Burn Startups should look for ways to reduce their monthly spend and extend their cash runway. Companies may want to consider the following: Remote Work: Consider whether it is important for the business that the team be in a central location or whether a remote workforce or a hybrid of both makes more financial sense. The pandemic has proven that, in some instances, a remote workforce is more efficient and cost-effective than a workforce that reports to a central location on a daily basis. Commercial rents are expensive, especially in big cities, and oftentimes drive up a company\u2019s budget. Removing expensive rents from a company\u2019s budget could be a pivotal cash-saving move. Of course, startups will need to weigh the impact of going remote on company culture and measure any financial (and nonfinancial) costs associated with shifting to a remote workforce. Many fully remote companies have increased company off-sites and other gatherings to preserve company culture. The costs of these events are sometimes not well understood when a company decides to shift to a remote workforce. Review Critical Talent Needs: Assess staffing needs and determine which positions are absolutely critical to maintain business operations. Consider scaling back positions that are not critical to the business and/or reassigning employees to duties that are more impactful to the business. Companies may also consider (i) renegotiating employee compensation and offering employees more equity and less cash compensation (which many startups are already inclined to do), (ii) moving some employees to a part-time schedule, (iii) furloughing noncritical employees for a period of time as the company navigates the current economic conditions, and (iv) laying off employees in noncritical departments. Of course, companies should consult qualified legal counsel before undertaking these steps to ensure compliance with the myriad of applicable employment laws. Minimum Viable Product: Companies may also need to consider whether it is possible to bring their products to market faster than anticipated. Adopting a product iteration approach to product launch is well-worn territory, especially for tech startups, and having a working product will help balance sheets if early customer adoption can translate into early revenue. Potential Sources of Funding It is important that startups maintain frequent communications about their progress and financial position with current investors. These investors are already incentivized to help the company as they have a financial stake in the company\u2019s survival. Investors may be persuaded to inject fresh capital to extend the runway of a portfolio company they have strong ties to and may ask peers to do the same. These same investors may also have other suggestions that could be helpful, and/or make introductions to potential customers or investors. Companies can also extend their cash runway in the near term by obtaining funding from conventional or alternative sources, such as those detailed below. Extensions or Flat Rounds: Startups may consider extending the terms of their last round or even doing a new round at the same price as their last round. While this would dilute current shareholders, it may be a viable option for companies that need to shore up their cash positions. Bridge Rounds: Startups should also consider bridge rounds of financing. A Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) or a Convertible Note could be a path to a quick cash injection with relatively low legal fees. SAFE and Convertible Notes have fewer terms to negotiate with investors, thus reducing the negotiation time and also allowing companies to delay setting a valuation on the company (which is often the subject of much negotiation). Venture Debt: While some of the most prominent and well-known venture debt lenders have pulled out entirely or scaled back their venture loan activity, there are a number of other banks that offer venture debt services for startups that could be explored, and new product offerings seem to be popping up from other lenders on a regular basis. Companies are well advised to speak with their banking partners, legal counsel or\u00a0financial advisers to understand what options may be available. Government Grants: There are a number of research-based government grants that startups can apply for that can potentially provide a necessary cash injection. Some state governments, such as New York, have recently announced programs that provide matching investment funds for startups that qualify (Pre-Seed and Seed Matching Fund Program). Similarly, certain financial institutions have pools of capital targeting underrepresented founders and communities. SaaS-Based Lending: Companies that sell software as a service (SaaS) can also apply for SaaS-based loans from nonbank lenders. These nonbank lenders allow companies to borrow money against recurring revenue streams and generally are nondilutive. In the event that the current economic challenges remain constant or worsen over the next few months, many startups may be forced to take more austere measures. Negotiations between companies and investors will lengthen, and investors generally will be able to demand more investor-favorable deal terms. Before initiating any of the options detailed below, companies should consult qualified legal counsel and determine whether any investor rights (e.g., blocking rights, voting rights, anti-dilution triggers, pro rata rights of others) are implicated or triggered by these options. Extended Financing Rounds: The time between financing rounds could be longer than before, as investors may require (i) stringent diligence and have less tolerance for deals outside the investor\u2019s risk parameters, (ii) stricter (i.e., less company-favorable) deal terms, and (iii) lower valuations. Whereas in 2021 a company may have been able to close a Series A financing within one to three months, that same round may now take between three to six months. Down Rounds: Companies may need to consider new rounds of financing where the pre-money valuation is lower than the post-money valuation of their prior round (known as a \u201cdown round\u201d). Startups generally try to avoid down rounds because the lower valuation may imply that investors have lost confidence in the company and because investors are frequently protected from down round dilution. However, in some instances, a down round could be beneficial and may be a sacrifice that some companies and investors are willing to make to better the company\u2019s chances of surviving. Consolidation: In times of economic uncertainty, many companies will consider consolidating with competitors to gain better market efficiencies and to ensure future success. A merger or an acquisition could be beneficial for startups whether they are being acquired by a larger company that is better positioned to weather a financial downturn or merging with another startup in their space to share cost. Companies that need additional funding should identify their well-funded competitors and consider approaching them as an acquisition target, and well-funded companies should reevaluate the opportunity to target companies with interesting technology (or talent) with favorable valuations. Pivot or Wind Down: The unfortunate truth is that, even under the best economic conditions, most startups fail. Some startups will exhaust their cash reserves and be forced to suspend all operations and wind down. While this is not what founders and investors wished for the company, if identified early enough, it could be an opportunity for founders to pivot and redouble efforts to find product-market fit. Of course, some startups may be better served by shutting down completely and returning some of their investors\u2019 money rather than attempting to make a hard pivot and restarting the search for product-market fit. Startups will need to implement elevated cash management, capital raise and exit measures to withstand the current market tumult. Companies should fully understand their economic position, scale back where possible and frequently communicate with investors. Making decisions early, before the situation is critical, will often result in a better outcome. We know the terrain will be rocky, but the companies that can extend runway and lower their cash burn may be in the best position to survive.

On May 30, the coalition filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in In Re: Fosamax (Alendronate Sodium) Products Liability Litigation, a consolidated case where hundreds of plaintiffs claimed to suffer femur fractures as a result of taking Merck drug Fosamax. The plaintiffs sued Merck under state products liability law, alleging the drug manufacturer failed to warn consumers of the risk of atypical femoral fractures. The District Court of New Jersey dismissed the claims, holding that the doctrine of impossibility preemption blocked the state law claims because the FDA rejected a warning label discussing the risk of stress fractures \u2014 making it impossible for Merck to comply with both state and federal law. In the amicus brief, the state AGs\u2019 emphasized that \u201c[s]tate sovereignty is the bedrock principal of our constitutional system,\u201d and that \u201cimpossibility preemption is and must remain a demanding defense.\u201d The state AGs went on to argue that the court\u2019s application of impossibility preemption \u201cvividly illustrates the potential for mischief\u201d because the label rejection at issue did not involve the \u201catypical fractures that injured the plaintiffs,\u201d but only \u201cstress fractures.\u201d Overall, the AGs claimed that impossibility preemption should be rarely applied, and Merck did not meet the heightened \u201cclear evidence\u201d standard. Why It Matters This intervention by state AGs on the appeal shows their concerns about the implications of the ruling and what it could mean in the future for their consumer protection statutory authority under their respective Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Acts. *Senior Government Relations Manager Send Print Report Latest PostsFTC Seeks Public Input on Joint Consumer Protection Efforts with State Attorneys General State AGs Choose Products Liability Case as Battleground for State Sovereignty With Great Hiring Power Comes Great Responsibility: EEOC Releases New Warnings for Employers Leveraging AI Sixth Circuit Holds Receipt of One Ringless Voicemail Causes Article III Harm Under the TCPA Nursing Homes, Beware!

Twitter RSS Feeds for Publishers For Reporters My Account Log In June 16, 2023 Seventh Circuit rules $3.95 in postage spent by plaintiff to respond to second validation notice sufficient to establish FDCPA standing John Culhane Jr., Reid Herlihy, Kristen Larson Ballard Spahr LLP + Follow x\u00a0Following x\u00a0Following - Unfollow Contact LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Send Embed To embed, copy and paste the code into your website or blog: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has ruled that a plaintiff in a putative class action had standing to assert FDCPA claims against the purchaser of her debt and the purchaser\u2019s servicer based on the $3.95 she paid in postage to respond to a second validation letter after she had already responded to the first validation notice. In Mack v. Resurgent Capital Services, L.P., the plaintiff had received an initial validation notice from the debt collector hired by the servicer of her debt.\u00a0 The letter informed her that her credit card account had been placed for collection and that she owed $7,179.87.\u00a0 It also identified the purchaser of her debt as the \u201ccurrent creditor.\u201d\u00a0 Within 30 days of receiving the letter, the plaintiff mailed a validation request to the debt collector, paying $6.70 in postage for priority mail and a $3.45 certified mail fee.\u00a0 The plaintiff then received a second validation letter sent by the servicer that identified the purchaser of her debt as the \u201ccurrent owner.\u201d\u00a0 She sent a second validation request to the servicer for which she paid fifty cents in postage for regular mail and a $3.45 certified mail fee. Having never received validation of her debt from the purchaser, servicer, or debt collector, the plaintiff filed a class action lawsuit against the purchaser and servicer alleging violations of the FDCPA.\u00a0 The plaintiff alleged that she was confused and alarmed by the second letter.\u00a0 She claimed that the defendants had engaged in a deceptive collection practice because the second validation letter \u201cwould cause any consumer, let alone the unsophisticated consumer, to believe that she must yet again dispute the Debt despite the fact that such consumer had already submitted a valid dispute of the Debt.\u201d The district court, treating the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss as a summary judgment motion, ruled that the plaintiff had failed to establish standing because the time and money spent to send the second validation request did not rise to the level of detriment required for FDCPA standing.\u00a0 According to the district court, the second letter \u201cdid not adversely affect any interests Congress sought to protect through the FDCPA and instead effectively provided [the plaintiff] with another opportunity to dispute her debt if she failed to properly do so upon receipt of the first letter.\u201d\u00a0 The district court also vacated its previous order certifying the class. As an initial matter, the Seventh Circuit indicated that because the district court should not have treated the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss as one for summary judgment, it would review the case as an appeal from a dismissal.\u00a0 The Seventh Circuit found that the second letter had caused the plaintiff \u201cto suffer a concrete detriment to her debt-management choices in the form of the expenditure of additional money to preserve rights that she had already preserved.\u201d\u00a0 According to the Seventh Circuit, \u201c[m]oney damages caused by misleading communications from the debt collector are certainly included in the sphere of interests that Congress sought to protect.\u201d The defendants argued that because the plaintiff spent the money to clear up her confusion, the cost was insufficient to establish standing.\u00a0 While acknowledging that it has previously held that confusion is not itself an injury, the Seventh Circuit indicated that the plaintiff was not alleging that confusion was itself her injury.\u00a0 Instead, she was alleging that her confusion caused her to act to her detriment, namely to spend extra money to preserve her right to seek validation, which she had been misled to believe she failed to do the first time.\u00a0 According to the Seventh Circuit, the plaintiff had been misled to her financial detriment and \u201cthat the dollar cost was modest is irrelevant.\u201d The Seventh Circuit reversed the dismissal and remanded the case to the district court to redefine the previously certified class to include only those persons who had acted to their detriment upon receiving a second validation letter.\u00a0 This restriction on class members is likely to substantially reduce the size of the class and could even mean that no class can be certified because so few people can satisfy this restriction.
