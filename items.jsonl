Twitter RSS Feeds for Publishers For Reporters My Account Log In June 22, 2023 Canadian patent fees to increase in 2024: The first comprehensive fee hike in 20 years Charlotte Dong, David Schwartz Smart & Biggar + Follow x\u00a0Following x\u00a0Following - Unfollow Contact LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Send Embed To embed, copy and paste the code into your website or blog: Amendments to the Patent Rules were published on June 21, 2023, revising the tariff of fees payable to the Canadian Patent Office, and broadening the small entity definition. The changes take effect on January 1, 2024. Applicants and patentees can pay future official fees now, at the lower 2023 rates, before the fee increases take effect. However, applicants and patentees having 51-99 employees may wish first to assess whether they will newly qualify as small entities as of January 1, 2024. In separate legislation, trademark and industrial design fees will also increase as of January 1, 2024. Table of contents Official fees increasing up to 36% in 2024 This will be the first comprehensive revision of the tariff of fees in 20 years. The revisions aim to increase most fees by 25%, without adjustment of small entity fees. However, because many fees payable to the Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO) have recently become variable on an annual basis under separate legislation to account for inflation, and recent inflation has been high, the actual fee increases for 2024 will range anywhere from 0% up to 36%. Changes for commonly paid fees include the following: *All fees CAD and shown at the standard entity undiscounted rate. For a complete schedule comparing the current fees and the 2024 fees, please see this link. As noted above, fees due in 2024 or later may be paid at the reduced 2023 rates if paid before January 1, 2024. More applicants and patentees may qualify to make small entity payments Many CIPO fees for patent applications and patents are discounted by 50% if the \u201csmall entity status condition\u201d is met for an application or patent. Currently, the small entity status condition is that: (a) in respect of an application for a patent \u2014 other than a PCT national phase application or a divisional application \u2014 the applicant of the application on the filing date is, on that date, an entity that has 50 employees or less or is a university, other than (i) an entity that is controlled directly or indirectly by an entity, other than a university, that has more than 50 employees, or (ii) an entity that has transferred or licensed, or has an obligation other than a contingent obligation to transfer or license, any right or interest in a claimed invention to an entity, other than a university, that has more than 50 employees; (b) in respect of an international application, the applicant of the application on the national phase entry date is, on that date, an entity that has 50 employees or less or is a university, other than an entity referred to in subparagraph (a)(i) or (ii); and (c) in respect of a divisional application, the applicable requirements of this provision are met in respect of the original application. As of January 1, 2024, the above entity size is increased from an entity that has 50 employees or less to an entity that has fewer than 100 employees. In other words, small entity status is changed to cover entities having 51-99 employees. It appears that the changes are in a sense retrospective,1 such that, if the applicant had more than 50 but fewer than 100 employees at the time of filing or national entry and the small entity condition was not met before the rule change, on or after January 1, 2024 it will nevertheless be possible to start paying small entity fees in the application or patent. By way of example, if an applicant having 75 employees files a Canadian patent application or enters the Canadian national phase on August 8, 2023, the small entity condition will not be satisfied (the applicant has more than 50 employees) and the filing fee must be paid at the standard entity rate. But as of January 1, 2024, under the new definition, the small entity condition was satisfied at filing (i.e. the applicant had fewer than 100 employees on August 8, 2023), so future payments may be made at the small entity rate. A \u201csmall entity declaration\u201d must be filed before small entity fee can be paid, so the applicant in the above example would have to file a small entity declaration on or after January 1, 2024 in order to pay small entity fees in the future. A refund of the difference between the standard entity fee and small entity fee for fees paid at the standard entity fee before a small entity declaration is not available.2 Therefore, in the above example, the applicant would not be entitled to a refund of 50% of the standard entity filing fee paid on August 8, 2023, prior to the change in the small entity definition. In sum, the effect of the change in the small entity definition is that, as of January 1, 2024, if the original applicant at the time of filing or national entry had fewer than 100 employees (and the other small entity conditions were met), it is possible to start paying small entity fees once a small entity declaration is filed. Counterintuitively, small entity status attaches to the application or patent, not the applicant or patentee, and is determined only once, at the time of filing or national entry. If an applicant that is a small entity at filing later grows to have more than 99 employees or assigns the application to a company with more than 99 employees, it remains possible to pay small entity fees for the life of the patent. Conversely, if a multi-national company files a patent application and later assigns the application or patent back to the inventor, the inventor must pay standard entity fees for the life of the patent, because the small entity condition was not met at the filing date. Recommendations to applicants and patentees Paying fees early As a cost-saving measure, applicants and patentees may wish to pay upcoming fees before the fees increase on January 1, 2024. Fees that reasonably might be paid early include at least the following: Maintenance fees \u2013 Any number of future annual maintenance fees could be paid in 2023. Examination fee \u2013 If the Canadian (PCT) filing date is before October 30, 2019, the examination fee must be paid within five years of the filing date. If the Canadian (PCT) filing date is on or after October 30, 2019, the examination fee must be paid within four years of the filing date. In any case, the examination fee may be paid earlier. Divisional applications \u2013 The greatest savings may be realized in divisional applications. All past-due maintenance fees from the second anniversary onward are payable when a divisional application is filed. In most instances, the deadline for requesting examination will be three months from filing. Of course, the filing fee must also be paid. The government fees payable with a divisional application may therefore be substantial. If a divisional application will ultimately be filed, costs will be reduced by filing it in 2023. Reviewing small entity status The increase in the size of an eligible small entity from 50 to 99 employees may permit small entity fees to be paid where this previously was not possible. As discussed above, the change applies only to fees paid on or after January 1, 2024 and requires submission of a small entity declaration. In a few instances, the change in the small entity definition could warrant deferring rather than advancing payment of a fee. For example, if small entity status will be acquired as of January 1, 2024, an applicant may prefer to wait until January 1, 2024 to file a small entity declaration and pay the examination fee at the small entity rate, rather than pay the examination fee at the 2023 standard rate. As the assessment of small entity status can be involved, applicants and patentees should obtain advice from their Canadian patent agent prior to claiming small entity status. Some historical background to patent fee revisions To the uninitiated, the annual changes to CIPO fees will be perplexing. For instance, in each year from 2004 through 2020, the patent application filing fee was $400. In 2021, the filing fee increased to $408 but then fell in 2022 to $407.18. In 2023, the filing fee rose again, this time to $421.02. For 2024, the fee will be $555. Why? At least part of the answer lies in separate federal legislation governing fee-setting procedures. The Federal User Fees Act was enacted in 2004, setting out burdensome requirements to be met for a regulatory authority to establish or increase a government fee. Before establishing or increasing a fee, the CIPO had to: notify clients and other regulating authorities with a similar clientele of the user fee proposed to be fixed or increased; give all clients or service users a reasonable opportunity to provide ideas or proposals for ways to improve the services to which the user fee relates; conduct an impact assessment to identify relevant factors, and take into account its findings in a decision to increase the user fee; explain to clients clearly how the user fee is determined and identify the cost and revenue elements of the user fee; establish an independent advisory panel to address a complaint submitted by a client regarding the user fee or change; and establish standards which are comparable to those established by other countries with which a comparison is relevant and against which the performance of the regulating authority can be measured. In addition, the federal government Minister responsible for CIPO was required to table a proposal in Parliament: explaining in respect of what service, product, regulatory process, facility, authorization, permit or licence the user fee is being proposed; stating the reason for any proposed change in user fee rate; including the performance standards established as described above and the actual performance levels that have been reached; giving an estimate of the total amount that will be collected in the first three fiscal years after the introduction of the user fee, and identifying the costs that the user fee will cover; and describing the establishment of an independent advisory panel as described above and explaining how any complaints received were dealt with. Finally, if the proposed fee was higher than that comparable fee in other countries, the Minister had to give reasons for the difference. The daunting work required under the User Fees Act to adjust a fee may have contributed to the lack of CIPO fee increases since 2004. The User Fees Act was repealed in 2017 and replaced by the Service Fees Act. The Service Fees Act reduced the complexity of the fee-setting process but introduced two new requirements: (1) automatic annual adjustment of fees; and (2) a requirement for remission of fees if a performance standard is not met. Under the Service Fees Act, fees are adjusted in each fiscal year\u2014on the anniversary of a date that is selected by the responsible authority with respect to the fee before the first adjustment\u2014by the percentage change over 12 months in the April All-items Consumer Price Index for Canada, as published by Statistics Canada under the Statistics Act, for the previous fiscal year. As the Consumer Price Index increases or decreases each year, CIPO fees (other than \u201clow materiality fees\u201d of less than CAD $150) rise and fall automatically, in non-rounded amounts. This explains why the application filing fee varied by small amounts in 2021, 2022, and 2023 as described above. A similar automatic adjustment will apply to all fees other than low materiality fees again in 2025. The Service Fees Act requires federal government authorities such as CIPO to set service standards for providing a service in return for a fee in consultation with interested persons. If a service standard is not met, CIPO must remit the portion of the fee that CIPO considers appropriate to the applicant or patentee. For example, the current service standard for granting a patent after payment of the final fee (i.e. issue fee) is 16 weeks. If the service standard is missed by 50% or less, 25% of the fee paid will be remitted. If the service standard is missed by more than 50%, 50% of the fee paid will be remitted.3 References 1. The definition of the small entity condition in section 44 of the Patent Rules has been replaced with a new definition, also reading in the present tense. There are no transitional provisions. Notably, the amendments as enacted do not include a provision (new section 224.1) contained in the original version of the rules as published for consultation in Canada Gazette, Part I, Volume 156, Number 53, on December 31, 2022. Proposed section 224.1 would have retained the 50-employee limit for small entities for applications filed or entering the national phase before January 1, 2024. Moreover, section 10 of the Interpretation Act provides that \u201cThe law shall be considered as always speaking, and where a matter or thing is expressed in the present tense, it shall be applied to the circumstances as they arise, so that effect may be given to the enactment according to its true spirit, intent and meaning.\u201d Section 12 provides that \u201cEvery enactment is deemed remedial, and shall be given such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as best ensures the attainment of its objects.\u201d 2. Section 139 of the Patent Rules provides a comprehensive closed list of the fees that may be refunded and does not include fees paid at the standard fee level when the applicant or patentee would be entitled to pay fees at the small entity level. Paragraph 139(1)(h) does permit a refund of \u201cany overpayment of a fee.\u201d However, payment of a fee at the standard entity level before filing a small entity declaration is not considered an \u201coverpayment.\u201d See \u00a710.02.02 of the Manual of Patent Office Practice confirming that \u201cIf a small entity declaration is submitted after a standard fee is paid, but before the fee-payment deadline, the standard fee payment will not be considered an overpayment and a refund of the difference between the standard and small fee amounts will not be provided for that particular payment.\u201d 3.

Helium is essential for its uses in the medical research, semiconductor manufacturing, space exploration and technology industries. With world class opportunities in Alberta and Saskatchewan for helium exploration and development, Canada is strategically situated to take advantage of helium's potential for energy diversification and increased investment opportunities. Demand for helium has grown rapidly in recent years, which has spurred increased exploration and development activities in Canada. Helium is listed on the Government of Canada's critical minerals list, which identifies 31 minerals and metals considered \"essential for the sustainable economic success of Canada and its trading partners.\" According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the primary global suppliers of helium are the United States, Russia, Qatar and Algeria. However, the United States' production has significantly declined between 2010 and 2018, from 80 percent to 56 percent of global production, opening the door for Canada and other countries to play a more significant role in the industry. Helium production is nothing new in Canada. The country has the fifth largest helium resource deposits in the world, is a trusted supplier and is the number two importer of helium into the United States, providing 20 percent of the United States' helium imports from 2018 to 2021. The Canada Energy Regulator has stated that helium demand could be partially met with Canadian-produced helium. The provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan continue to take steps to meet global demand in helium and promote investment in helium production. Recent Helium Developments in Alberta and Saskatchewan Alberta Developments As a significant supplier of Canada's natural gas, Alberta is well-positioned to become a key producer and supplier of helium. The Alberta government announced this year that it will soon add helium to its list of critical minerals to align with Canada's critical mineral list and to increase support for helium development. Alberta's Emissions Reduction and Energy Development Plan positions critical metals, like helium, as a key component for the energy transition, given their use in wind turbines, batteries, electric vehicles and energy storage cells. The province has further signaled helium development as a high growth potential for the province and an opportunity for Alberta to be a leader in emissions reduction, clean technology and sustainable resource development. According to the plan, the province is supporting the industry to develop technology to extract helium and will explore efforts to support Alberta's helium development in collaboration with the federal government. Helium is in part regulated under the Alberta Petroleum and Natural Gas Tenure Regulation. The regulation governs the issuance and administration of Crown petroleum and natural gas mineral rights (including helium) and the obligations of lessees under licenses and leases. Helium royalties are regulated under the Natural Gas Royalty Regulation, 2009 and Natural Gas Royalty Regulation, 2017 (collectively, the Royalty Regulations). The Royalty Regulations were amended, effective April 1, 2020, to add a new Schedule 6.1, which specifically addresses helium royalties in Alberta. Pursuant to these amendments, operators producing helium must submit monthly reports on production volumes and average selling prices of helium to the Department of Energy. The amendments also established a 4.25 percent royalty rate for helium in Alberta. Alberta's new helium reporting requirements and the introduction of a royalty rate provide some certainty on the regulation of helium in the province and certain costs of production, which may invite greater investment in the industry. Saskatchewan Developments Saskatchewan is a major player in the mineral industry as it has 23 of the 31 minerals listed on the Canadian critical minerals list. The province was Canada's largest helium producer in 2022 with a number of active drilling, purification facilities and liquefaction efforts. Saskatchewan currently has the largest helium purification facility in Canada, which solidified the province as a key contributor to the global helium industry. Further, it is one of the few jurisdictions in the world that supports the drilling of dedicated helium wells, rather than as a byproduct of hydrocarbon production. Production from such dedicated wells results in less greenhouse gas emissions than other jurisdictions because such wells often contain non-greenhouse gases such as nitrogen. In November 2021, the Government of Saskatchewan released the Helium Action Plan: From Exploration to Experts (HAP), which is a comprehensive strategy to support growth in the province's helium industry. The HAP outlines a number of areas of focus including scaling-up exploration activities, enhancing helium production, fostering innovation commercialization in the field, building-out Saskatchewan's helium purification and liquefaction capacity and establishing export infrastructure. According to the HAP, Saskatchewan is striving to produce 10 percent of the world's helium by 2030. More recently, the province launched Securing the Future: Saskatchewan's Critical Minerals Strategy on March 27, 2023. The strategy outlines four critical mineral goals, including: to increase Saskatchewan's share of Canadian mineral exploration spending to 15 percent by 2030; to double the number of critical minerals being produced in Saskatchewan by 2030; to grow Saskatchewan's production of potash, uranium and helium; and to establish Saskatchewan as a rare Earth element hub. Saskatchewan has had a well-established helium regulatory regime prior to many other competing jurisdictions. A number of acts and regulations govern helium exploration, development, production and end-of-life activities in Saskatchewan. Some of these include the Crown Minerals Act, The Oil and Gas Tenure Registry Regulations (OGTRR) and the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. Saskatchewan has had a royalty rate specific to helium since 1964. In line with Alberta, the current helium royalty rate in Saskatchewan is 4.25 percent. The OGTRR governs helium and associated gases tenure. Permits and leases for helium may be obtained through Saskatchewan's Integrated Resource Information System, which is an online business system that supports the development and regulation of Saskatchewan's energy and resources industry. The permits grant exploration rights for helium and associated gases; but holders of such permits may not remove, produce or recover any helium until they are granted a lease. In 2021, Saskatchewan issued 126 permits and 72 leases for helium production.

The technology advanced through the subsequent centuries, culminating in an exponential explosion of growth over the last hundred years or so, with the advent of artificial refrigerants in the 19-teens and 20s. Still, these early-model units relied on toxic, foul-smelling gases such as ammonia and sulfur dioxide as condensing agents, resulting in fatalities from exposure. Through the middle of the last century, the industry transitioned almost entirely over to the use of the non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon (\u201cCFC\u201d) Freon as the primary refrigerant. This move virtually eliminated the health risks, reduced the price of refrigeration in general, and further fueled the mass-expansion of refrigeration in commercial and home use. That is, up until the 70\u2019s, when scientists realized that Freon escaping from old, damaged, or abandoned refrigerators was disintegrating the protective ozone layer of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and letting in dangerous ultra-violet radiation from the sun. Enter a new class of refrigerants, hydrofluorocarbons (\u201cHFC\u201d); all the benefits of CFC\u2019s, without that pesky risk of microwaving the planet. Up until roughly the turn of the century, that is, \u00a0when scientists have discovered that HFC\u2019s trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. Recently, to combat the warming impact of HFC\u2019s, Congress passed the American Innovation in Manufacturing Act (\u201cAIM\u201d), which authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) to do essentially three things; manage existing HFC\u2019s, phase down their production, and facilitate the transition to next-generation replacement technologies. In one of the first rulings on the new AIM legislation, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals has on June 20sided with proponents of the air conditioning industry, holding that AIM does not grant the EPA the unfettered right to ban certain methodologies used by the industry in transporting HFCs. While not a broad and sweeping rebuke of the AIM, it is notable and significant because the imposition of limits on the AIM suggests more industry players reliant on HFC\u2019s may \u2018smell blood in the water\u2019 and be emboldened to further challenge what was, until recently, seen by some as the harbinger of the next sea-change in the ongoing story of refrigeration technology.

The audience was primarily comprised of bank directors who sit on audit and risk committees Please see full article below for more information. Download PDF 5As a result of recent bank failures, bank directors must monitor the levels of uninsured deposits, deposit concentrations, deposit withdrawals, sources of liquidity, and interest rate risk.We discussed what we learned from the recent bank failures. With the dominance of social media and mobile banking, a bank run can happen much faster today than any time in history.3The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is very concerned about discriminatory practices when underwriting loans. The use of AI in loan underwriting may prove to be trap for those that are not fully informed.There was discussion about artificial intelligence (AI) risk, how banks may be using it, and whether third-party vendors are using AI. There are many ways to use AI to create efficiencies and the challenge is that it is potentially fraught with risk and much is still unknown. For example, there are significant privacy risks especially if customer data is involved and, if it is being used by third-party vendors, due diligence is critical.1While we discussed the key risks facing banks today, such as liquidity, credit, particularly commercial real estate loans, interest rate risk resulting from the recent rapid increase in interest rates by the Fed, third-party vendor risk, and consumer compliance, the importance of the board governance process overseeing risk was stressed.Risks Facing Banks Today5 KEY TAKEAWAYSKilpatrick Townsend\u2019s Gary Bronstein recently joined a panel of other industry leaders at \u201cThe Bank Director: Bank Audit and Risk Conference\u201d.

Information for EU and Swiss Residents JD Supra's principal place of business is in the United States. By subscribing to our website, you expressly consent to your information being processed in the United States. Our Legal Basis for Processing: Generally, we rely on our legitimate interests in order to process your personal information. For example, we rely on this legal ground if we use your personal information to manage your Registration Data and administer our relationship with you; to deliver our Website and Services; understand and improve our Website and Services; report reader analytics to our authors; to personalize your experience on our Website and Services; and where necessary to protect or defend our or another's rights or property, or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, safety or privacy issues. Please see Article 6(1)(f) of the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") In addition, there may be other situations where other grounds for processing may exist, such as where processing is a result of legal requirements (GDPR Article 6(1)(c)) or for reasons of public interest (GDPR Article 6(1)(e)). Please see the \"Your Rights\" section of this Privacy Policy immediately below for more information about how you may request that we limit or refrain from processing your personal information. Your Rights Right of Access/Portability: You can ask to review details about the information we hold about you and how that information has been used and disclosed. Note that we may request to verify your identification before fulfilling your request. You can also request that your personal information is provided to you in a commonly used electronic format so that you can share it with other organizations. Right to Correct Information: You may ask that we make corrections to any information we hold, if you believe such correction to be necessary. Right to Restrict Our Processing or Erasure of Information: You also have the right in certain circumstances to ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or to erase your personal information. Where you have consented to our use of your personal information, you can withdraw your consent at any time. You can make a request to exercise any of these rights by emailing us at privacy@jdsupra.com or by writing to us at: Privacy Officer JD Supra, LLC 150 Harbor Drive, #2760 Sausalito, CA 94965 You can also manage your profile and subscriptions through our Privacy Center under the \"My Account\" dashboard. We will make all practical efforts to respect your wishes. There may be times, however, where we are not able to fulfill your request, for example, if applicable law prohibits our compliance. Please note that JD Supra does not use \"automatic decision making\" or \"profiling\" as those terms are defined in the GDPR. Timeframe for retaining your personal information: We will retain your personal information in a form that identifies you only for as long as it serves the purpose(s) for which it was initially collected as stated in this Privacy Policy, or subsequently authorized. We may continue processing your personal information for longer periods, but only for the time and to the extent such processing reasonably serves the purposes of archiving in the public interest, journalism, literature and art, scientific or historical research and statistical analysis, and subject to the protection of this Privacy Policy. For example, if you are an author, your personal information may continue to be published in connection with your article indefinitely. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
